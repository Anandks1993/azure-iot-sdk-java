/**
 * Representation of a single Device Provisioning Service X509 Attestation.
 *
 * <p> The provisioning service supports Device Identifier Composition Engine, or DICE, as the device attestation
 *     mechanism. To use DICE, user must provide the X509 certificate. This class provide the means to create a new
 *     attestation for a X509 certificate and return it as an abstract interface {@link Attestation}.
 *
 * <p> An X509 attestation can contains one of the 2 types of certificate:
 *
 * <dl>
 *     <dt><b>Client or Alias certificate:</b>
 *     <dd>Called on this class as clientCertificates, this certificate can authenticate a single device.
 * </dl>
 * <dl>
 *     <dt><b>Signing or Root certificate:</b>
 *     <dd>Called on this class as rootCertificates, this certificate can create multiple Client certificates
 *         to authenticate multiple devices.
 * </dl>
 *
 * <p> The provisioning service allows user to create {@link Enrollment} and {@link EnrollmentGroup}. For all
 *     operations over {@link Enrollment} with <b>DICE</b>, user must provide a <b>clientCertificates</b>, and
 *     for operations over {@link EnrollmentGroup}, user must provide a <b>rootCertificates</b>.
 *
 * <p> For each of this types of certificates, user can provide 2 Certificates, a primary and a secondary. Only the
 *     primary is mandatory, the secondary is optional.
 *
 * <p> The provisioning service will process the provided certificates, but will never return it back. Instead of
 *     it, {@link #getPrimaryX509CertificateInfo()} and {@link #getSecondaryX509CertificateInfo()} will return a
 *     translated info in the certificate.
